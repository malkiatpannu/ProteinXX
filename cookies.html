            <p>When you visit websites today, certain information is automatically created and stored, including on this website.
                If you visit our website as you are right now, our web server (computer on which this website is stored) automatically saves data such as
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the address (URL) of the accessed website</li>

        <div id="cookies">
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>
            Our website uses HTTP cookies to store user-specific data. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In the following we explain what cookies are and why they are used so that you can better understand the following data protection declaration.
            </p>
            <h5><b>
            What exactly are cookies?</b>
            </h5>
            <p>Whenever you surf the Internet, you use a browser. Well-known browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text files in your browser. These files are called cookies.</p>
            <p>One thing cannot be denied: Cookies are really useful little helpers. Almost all websites use cookies. More precisely, they are HTTP cookies, as there are other cookies for other areas of application. HTTP cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by our website. These cookie files are automatically stored in the cookie folder, which is basically the "brain" of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. When defining a cookie, one or more attributes must also be specified.</p>
            <p>Cookies store certain user data from you, such as language or personal page settings. When you visit our site again, your browser transmits the "user-related" information back to our site. Thanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are used to. In some browsers each cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox all cookies are stored in a single file.</p>
            <p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our site, third-party cookies are created by partner websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be evaluated individually, since each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, Trojans or other "pests". Cookies also cannot access information on your PC.</p>
            <p>A browser should be able to support these minimum sizes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
                <li>At least 50 cookies per domain</li>
                <li>At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
            </ul>
            <h5><b>
            What types of cookies are there?</b>
            </h5>
            <p>The question of which cookies we use in particular depends on the services used and is clarified in the following sections of the data protection declaration. At this point we would like to briefly explain the different types of HTTP cookies.</p>
            <p>There are 4 types of cookies:</p>
            <p><b>Essential cookies</b></p>
            <p>These cookies are necessary to ensure basic functions of the website. For example, these cookies are needed if a user puts a product in the shopping cart, then continues surfing on other pages and only goes to the checkout later. These cookies do not delete the shopping cart, even if the user closes their browser window.</p>
            <p><b>Functional cookies</b></p>
            <p>These cookies collect information about user behavior and whether the user receives any error messages. In addition, these cookies are also used to measure the loading time and behavior of the website in different browsers.</p>
            <p><b>Targeting cookies</b></p>
            <p>These cookies ensure a better user experience. For example, entered locations, font sizes or form data are saved.</p>
            <p><b>Advertising cookies</b></p>
            <p>These cookies are also called targeting cookies. They are used to provide the user with individually tailored advertising. This can be very useful, but also very annoying.</p>
            <p>Usually, when you visit a website for the first time, you will be asked which of these types of cookies you would like to allow. And of course this decision is also stored in a cookie</p>
            <p>We use both session and persistent Cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><h5>
                        <b>Necessary / Essential Cookies</b>
                    </h5>
                    <p>Type: Session Cookies</p>
                    <p>Administered by: us</p>
                    <p>Purpose: These Cookies are essential to provide You with services available through the Website and to enable You to use some of its features. They help to authenticate users and prevent fraudulent use of user accounts. Without these Cookies, the services that You have asked for cannot be provided, and We only use these Cookies to provide You with those services.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h5>
                        <b>Functionality Cookies</b>
                    </h5>
                    <p>Type: Persistent Cookies</p>
                    <p>Administered by: us</p>
                    <p> Purpose: These Cookies allow us to remember choices You make when You use the Website, such as remembering your login details or language preference. The purpose of these Cookies is to provide You with a more personal experience and to avoid You having to re-enter your preferences every time You use the Website.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5><b>
            How can I delete cookies?</b>
            </h5>
            <p>
            You decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the cookies come from, you always have the option of deleting or deactivating cookies or only partially allowing them. For example, you can block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you want to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, if you want to change or delete cookie settings, you can find this in your browser settings:

            If you generally do not want any cookies, you can set up your browser so that it always informs you when a cookie is to be set. You can decide for each individual cookie whether you allow the cookie or not. The procedure differs depending on the browser. It is best to search for the instructions in Google with the search term Delete cookies Chrome or Deactivate cookies Chrome in the case of a Chrome browser.

            <h5><b>
            What about my data protection?</b>
            </h5>
            <p>The so-called Cookie Guidelines have been in place since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires your consent. Within the EU countries, however, there are still very different reactions to these directives. In Austria, however, this directive was implemented in Section 96 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).</p>
            <p>If you want to know more about cookies and don't shy away from technical documentation, we recommend <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265</a> , the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments called HTTP State Management Mechanism.</p>

            If you send us personal data by e-mail - thus outside of this website - we cannot guarantee a secure transmission and the protection of your data. We recommend that you never send confidential data unencrypted by e-mail.

            Google reCAPTCHA Privacy Policy
            </h2>
            <p>
            Our primary goal is to secure and protect our website for you and for us in the best possible way. To ensure this, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google Inc. The company Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services in Europe. With reCAPTCHA we can determine if you really are a real human being and not a robot or other spam software. We understand spam to mean any unwanted information that is sent to us electronically, unsolicited. With the classic CAPTCHAS, you usually had to solve text or image puzzles to check them. With reCAPTCHA from Google, we don't have to bother you with such puzzles most of the time. In most cases it is sufficient if you simply check the box and confirm that you are not a bot. With the new Invisible reCAPTCHA version, you don't even have to check the box. You can find out exactly how this works and, above all, what data is used for this in the course of this data protection declaration.

            <h5><b>
            What is reCAPTCHA?
            </b></h5>

            <p>
            reCAPTCHA is a free captcha service provided by Google that protects websites from spam software and abuse by non-human visitors. Most often, this service is used when filling out forms on the Internet. A captcha service is a type of automated Turing test designed to ensure that an action on the internet is being performed by a human and not a bot. In the classic Turing test (named after the computer scientist Alan Turing), a human determines the difference between a bot and a human. In the case of captchas, the computer or a software program also takes care of this. Classic captchas work with small tasks that are easy for humans to solve, but present significant difficulties for machines. With reCAPTCHA you no longer have to actively solve puzzles. The tool uses modern risk techniques to distinguish humans from bots. Here you only have to tick the text field "I'm not a robot" or with Invisible reCAPTCHA even that is no longer necessary. With reCAPTCHA, a JavaScript element is integrated into the source text and then the tool runs in the background and analyzes your user behavior. The software calculates a so-called Captcha score from these user actions. Google uses this score to calculate the probability that you are a human before entering the Captcha. reCAPTCHA or Captchas in general are always used when bots could manipulate or misuse certain actions (such as registrations, surveys, etc.). Here you only have to tick the text field "I'm not a robot" or with Invisible reCAPTCHA even that is no longer necessary. With reCAPTCHA, a JavaScript element is integrated into the source text and then the tool runs in the background and analyzes your user behavior. The software calculates a so-called Captcha score from these user actions. Google uses this score to calculate the probability that you are a human before entering the Captcha.

            <h5><b>
            Why do we use reCAPTCHA on our website?
            </b></h5>

            <p>
            We only want to welcome flesh and blood people to our site. Bots or spam software of all kinds can safely stay at home. That's why we're doing everything we can to protect ourselves and offer you the best possible user experience. For this reason we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google. So we can be pretty sure that we remain a "bot-free" website. By using reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google to determine whether you are really a human being. reCAPTCHA therefore serves to ensure the security of our website and subsequently also your security. For example, without reCAPTCHA it could happen that a bot registers as many email addresses as possible during registration, to then "spam" forums or blogs with undesirable advertising content. With reCAPTCHA we can avoid such bot attacks.
            </p>

            <h5><b>
            What data is stored by reCAPTCHA?
            </b></h5>

            <p>
            reCAPTCHA collects personal data from users to determine whether the actions on our website really come from people. The IP address and other data that Google needs for the reCAPTCHA service can therefore be sent to Google. IP addresses are almost always shortened within the member states of the EU or other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area before the data ends up on a server in the USA. The IP address is not combined with other data from Google unless you are logged in with your Google account while using reCAPTCHA. First, the reCAPTCHA algorithm checks whether Google cookies from other Google services (YouTube, Gmail, etc.) are already placed on your browser.
            </p>

            <p>The following list of collected browser and user data does not claim to be complete. Rather, they are examples of data that, to our knowledge, are processed by Google.</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Referrer URL (the address of the page the visitor came from)</li>
                <li>IP address (e.g. 190.123.123.1)</li>
                <li>Information about the operating system (the software that enables your computer to operate. Known operating systems are Windows, Mac OS X or Linux)</li>
                <li>Cookies (small text files that store data in your browser)</li>
                <li>Mouse and keyboard behavior (every action you perform with the mouse or keyboard is saved)</li>
                <li>Date and language settings (which language or which date you have preset on your PC is saved)</li>
                <li>All JavaScript objects (JavaScript is a programming language that allows websites to adapt to the user. JavaScript objects can collect all kinds of data under one name)</li>
                <li>Screen resolution (shows how many pixels the image display consists of)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            It is undisputed that Google uses and analyzes this data even before you click on the "I'm not a robot" tick. With the Invisible reCAPTCHA version, you don't even have to check the box and the whole recognition process runs in the background. Google does not tell you in detail how much and what data Google stores.
            </p>

            <h5><b>
            How long and where is the data stored?
            </b></h5>

            <p>
            By inserting reCAPTCHA, your data will be transferred to the Google server. Where exactly this data is stored is not made clear by Google, even after repeated inquiries. Without having received confirmation from Google, it can be assumed that data such as mouse interaction, time spent on the website or language settings on the European or American Google servers are stored. The IP address that your browser transmits to Google is generally not merged with other Google data from other Google services. However, if you are logged into your Google account while using the reCAPTCHA plugin, the data will be merged.  The deviating data protection regulations of the company Google apply.
            </p>

            <h5><b>
            How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?
            </b></h5>

            <p>
            If you do not want any data about you and your behavior to be transmitted to Google, you must log out of Google completely and delete all Google cookies before you visit our website or use the reCAPTCHA software. In principle, the data is automatically transmitted to Google as soon as you access our site. To delete this data again, you must  contact Google Support at <a href="https://support.google.com/?hl=de&amp;tid=111401120">https://support.google.com/?hl=de&tid=111401120</a>  .
            </p>

            <p>
            So if you use our website, you agree that Google LLC and its representatives automatically collect, process and use data.
